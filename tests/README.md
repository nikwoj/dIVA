# Test Functions
The data is one of three types, differentiated solely by how the data is stored within the files. The three types are SCV, Laplace, and Brain. Also of note is how the test functions within each section are categorized: test files ending with RA, CA#, and FA all mean the following:

RA

    Random mixing matrix generated by numpy.random.rand will be used to create the observations

CA#

    Random mixing matrix generated by numpy.random.rand will be modified such that all its condition number is less than or equal to #

FA

    Mixing matrix will be obtained through file. File for mixing matrix must be seperate from file for data


SCV data

    Contained in .mat file, but within the file contained in array where each entry is an array representing a subject

Laplace data

    Contained in single .mat file, but contained as single 3-dimensional array, where first dimension is number of components, second number of samples, third number of subjects. Compare to SCV, where the array is 2-dimensional, with every entry being an array whose dimensions are number of components by number of samples

Brain

    Contained in multiple .mat files, one corresponding to each subject
