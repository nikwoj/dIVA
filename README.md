# IVA
For implementation of normal and distributed IVA

The current file system should be relatively intuitive: regular contains the files for a single site IVA, distributed contains files for multiple site IVA, and related_files contains items for both, such as the random multivariate laplacian generator function. 

I may add seperate Readme's (if that's possible...) for each of the folders to describe file dependencies at a later date.
